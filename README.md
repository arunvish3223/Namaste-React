I'm learning React.js by taking Akshay Saini's "Namaste React" course.  Fundamental React concepts like as JSX, components, props, state management, hooks, and performance optimisation are thoroughly covered in this course.  Akshay makes difficult subjects simple to understand by breaking things down into beginner-friendly terms and using examples from everyday life.  I'm using this repository to put what I've learnt in each lecture into practice and create a practical project from the ground up.  I'm gaining a solid foundation in contemporary frontend development with React thanks to this adventure.  I'll keep this repository updated as I advance in the course and mature as a developer.
